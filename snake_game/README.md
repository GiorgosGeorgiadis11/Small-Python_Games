# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food (blue circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Files
- `main.py`: Main script to run the game. It initializes the screen, creates the snake, food, scoreboard, and handles the game logic.
- `snake.py`: Defines the Snake class with methods to control the snake's movement and behavior.
- `food.py`: Defines the Food class responsible for generating food at random positions on the screen.
- `scoreboard.py`: Implements the Scoreboard class to display the player's score and high score. The high score is stored in a file named `highscore.txt` located in the same directory.

## How to Run
